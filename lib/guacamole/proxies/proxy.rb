    # This is the base class for the association proxies. Proxies are only
    # needed for non-embedded relations between objects. Embedded objects are
    # taken care of by Virtus.
    #
    # The `Proxy` class undefines most methods and passes them to the
    # `@target`.  The `@target` will be a lambda which will lazy query the
    # requested objects from the database.
    #
    # Concrete proxy classes are:
    #
    #  * {Guacamole::Proxies::ReferencedBy}: This will handle one-to-many associations
    #  * {Guacamole::Proxies::References}: This will handle many-to-one associations

      # Convenience method to setup the proxy. The subclasses need to care of creating
      # the `target` correctly.
      #
      # @param [Object] base The class holding the reference. Currently not used.
      # @param [#call] target The lambda for getting the required objects from the database.
